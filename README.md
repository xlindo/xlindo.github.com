### Custom Link Icons
Users can provide their own icons by placing a `.svg` image in `./assets/icons/` in their own repo. Creating folders when necessary. The image should be as square as possible for the best result. Don't use spaces in the filename!
The background color will be the tailwind color `bg-indigo-500` (#6366f1) unless another color is specified. This can be done by placing the following css snippet in `./assets/css/custom.css`:

```css
.link-nameOfIcon {
  background-color: #6366f1; /* Hex color code */
}
```
Where `nameOfIcon` is be the name of the custom `.svg` file.

## Update the Theme Version

The theme version used to build the site is defined in `go.mod` file.

The best practice is to update to released and tested versions. To update to a specific version execute the following command in a terminal/commandline (at the root path of your site repo):

```shell
  hugo mod get github.com/chrede88/L1nkr@vX.Y.Z
```
Replace X,Y & Z with the corresponding version numbers. You can find the releases [here](https://github.com/chrede88/L1nkr/releases). Please check if any breaking changes are listed under the release you want to update to, before proceeding.

## Deploy on Github Pages
You can very easily deploy your site using Github Pages. Included in this template is a Github Action workflow that will build and deploy your site to Github Pages automatically:+1:

You can find the workflow here `.github/deploymentWorkflow/buildDeploy.yml`. To use this, move it to `.github/workflows/`.

The workflow is already set up and ready to go, but go through it and spend some time to understand what's going on. Otherwise, it'll always be this black box of magic that you can't fix when it breaks!

Last step: Go to Settings -> Pages -> Build and deployment -> Set the Source to "Github Actions".

Next time you publish a release this workflow will build and deploy your site :tada:

Your site will be published to the following URL:
`https://<username>.github.io/<repo>`, where `<username>` and `<repo>` is your Github username and the name of your repository.
